https://leetcode.com/problems/candy

I really wanted to try solving this one with just one loop, which is why there is 'nonsolution.c' which is mostly just a collection of completely disjointed thoughts that probably don't make a lot of sense to read together. It got really edge casey but I'm keeping it around in case I want to review/remember what I was trying to do later.

Prompt:
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

    Each child must have at least one candy.
    Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
